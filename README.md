This is a project from college.
Using Python I extracted data from the [BNR website](https://www.cursbnr.ro/), using Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries.
I took a currency according to my number from the catalog and starting from 03/27/2005.
After that I used the ARIMA model to make a prediction for the next day.
